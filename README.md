# Uncle bob will not be proud of this repo

This is a pretty challenging task. The more conditions I wrote for proper scoring, the more conditions needs to be written to cover all the possible consequences, I thought that I will finish this task in 2 hours, what a fool :D.
Non technicall challenges were also quite a thing to overcome, like self-discpiline, due to abscense of deadlines.

# About the app
Root path will lead you to the creation of a session, you can select up to 8 players.
Then you will be redirected to players creation route, where you can iteratively type in players name.
The final important route is session view, where you can add score for each frame and shot for each player.

## Note
The codebase is flooded with unused views/controllers boilerplate, and some unused model fields.
